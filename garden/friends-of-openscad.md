## 😘 Acknowledge Friends of SCAD
* [Fornjot](https://www.fornjot.app/) built in RUST, similar to OpenSCAD with boundary representation.
* 🐍.python [CadQuery/cadquery]() - a popular python centric dialect that is turing complete and therefore perhaps better suited for systems coding & simulation.
* C++ [OpenCascade]() - a wholly separate but similar distant cousin of OpenSCAD.
* [ImplicitCAD]() may not use OpenSCAD (can't tell)
