## What about this [19o1]

This is a personal identifier based on the system from Professor Luhmann who used a `Zettelkasten` to manage his train of thoughts.

> **Note:**
> The ideas are like UUIDs but human maintainable.
> Starting with a number they are then split with sub-identifiers with letters
> further splitting with numbers again - and so on.
> The goal is to always be able to insert new sub-identifiers if needed.

- `19` is my personal identifier for my `printing projects`
- `o` for `apps for generation`
- `1` for `OpenSCAD`
