## Goal
Attempting to bring more awesomeness & harmony to the OpenSCAD community.


I am marking this project as WIP planning for a better awesome-list.   An even awesomer OpenSCAD object/tool library 'embeddable awesome browser' & object discovery & repo package manager.

Using RUST & git, perhaps based on RUST spacedrive that is updating with compatible projects built into this awesome list.

The intention is to make something that is one unified repo for OpenSCAD package objects (similar to a npmjs.org pip, but using RUST cargo)

> **IMPORTANT:**
> If you have an OpenSCAD project and would like to be part of this list please
> add your project, create a pull request and stay tuned.
