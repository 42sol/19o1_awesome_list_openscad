## Goal (start here)
Attempting to bring more awesomeness & harmony to the `OpenSCAD` community.

Collect curated bits and pieces around the OpenSCAD topic.
An awesome-list consist normally in links only. Due to the nature of `OpenSCAD` it will also contain files and images (renderings) of models.

This awesome list is modeled like a house. Feel free to entry in the [lobby with organizational information](./lobby/readme.adoc) or enter the different [rooms grouped in topics ](./rooms/readme.adoc) or just stroll through the [garden and look into the garden of our neighbors](./garden/readme.adoc)

> **NOTE:**
> For models please use www.printable.com links if available.

I am marking this project as WIP planning for a better awesome-list.


> **IMPORTANT:**
> If you have an OpenSCAD project and would like to be part of this list please
> add your project, create a pull request and stay tuned.
